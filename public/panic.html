                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent and unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear that triggers severe physical reactions when there is no real danger or apparent cause. People with panic disorder live in fear of having another attack, which can lead them to avoid certain situations or places. This fear of fear, known as anticipatory anxiety, can be extremely disabling and significantly impact a person's quality of life. However, panic disorder is treatable, and seeking help is a crucial first step toward recovery.</p>

                            <h2>Symptoms of a Panic Attack</h2>
                            <p>Panic attacks typically begin suddenly, without warning. They can strike at any time — when you're driving a car, at the mall, sound asleep or in the middle of a business meeting. Symptoms of a panic attack usually peak within minutes and may include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A sense of impending doom or danger.</li>
                                <li>Fear of loss of control or death.</li>
                                <li>Rapid, pounding heart rate (palpitations).</li>
                                <li>Sweating, trembling, or shaking.</li>
                                <li>Shortness of breath or tightness in your throat.</li>
                                <li>Chills or hot flashes.</li>
                                <li>Nausea or abdominal cramping.</li>
                                <li>Chest pain and dizziness.</li>
                                <li>Numbness or tingling sensation.</li>
                                <li>Feeling of unreality or detachment (derealization or depersonalization).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>One of the worst things about panic attacks is the intense fear that you'll have another one. This fear can be so severe that you avoid situations where they may occur.</p>

                            <h2>Causes & Triggers</h2>
                            <p>It's not known what causes panic attacks or panic disorder, but certain factors may play a role. These can include a combination of genetics, major life stress, and changes in the way parts of your brain function.</p>
                             <ul>
                                <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> If you have a close family member with panic disorder, you are more likely to develop it yourself.</li>
                                <li><strong>Major Stress:</strong> Experiencing a severely stressful event, such as the death of a loved one, a serious illness, or a major life transition, can precede the onset of panic attacks.</li>
                                <li><strong>Temperament:</strong> Individuals who have a temperament that is more sensitive to stress or prone to negative emotions may be at higher risk.</li>
                                <li><strong>Brain Function:</strong> Some research suggests that an overactive "fight or flight" response may be involved. The brain's fear circuits can become overly sensitive, triggering a panic response even in the absence of a real threat.</li>

                            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
                            <p>A doctor or mental health professional must determine if you have panic disorder. After ruling out other medical conditions that can mimic panic symptoms (like heart or thyroid problems), you will likely undergo a psychological evaluation. To be diagnosed with panic disorder according to the DSM-5, you must experience recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, and at least one of the attacks has been followed by one month or more of persistent concern about having additional attacks or their consequences, and/or a significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks (such as avoidance of certain situations).</p>

                            <h2>Treatment & Coping</h2>
                            <p>Treatment can greatly reduce the intensity and frequency of your panic attacks and improve your function in daily life. The main treatment options are psychotherapy and medications, often used in combination.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Psychotherapy</h3>
                            <p>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is considered one of the most effective forms of treatment for panic disorder. Your therapist can help you understand panic attacks and learn ways to cope. You may learn to recognize the physical sensations of panic as less threatening and challenge the fearful thoughts that fuel the attacks. Exposure therapy within CBT can also help you confront feared situations in a safe and controlled manner.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Medications</h3>
                            <p>Medications can help reduce symptoms associated with panic attacks as well as depression. Several types of medication have been shown to be effective in managing symptoms of panic attacks, including Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs). In some cases, benzodiazepines may be prescribed for short-term, rapid relief of panic symptoms, but they are typically not recommended for long-term use.</p>
