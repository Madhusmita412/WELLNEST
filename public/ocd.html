                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition characterized by a pattern of unwanted thoughts and fears (obsessions) that lead you to do repetitive behaviors (compulsions). These obsessions and compulsions interfere with daily activities and cause significant distress. While you may recognize that your obsessions aren't reasonable, you may feel powerless to stop them and the compulsive rituals you perform. OCD is a chronic condition, but with effective treatment, individuals can manage their symptoms and live full, productive lives.</p>

                            <h2>Symptoms: Obsessions vs. Compulsions</h2>
                            <p>OCD includes both obsessions and compulsions, though it's possible to have only one. However, most people with OCD experience both.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Obsessions</h3>
                            <p>Obsessions are repeated, persistent, and unwanted thoughts, urges, or images that are intrusive and cause distress or anxiety. You might try to ignore them or get rid of them by performing a compulsive behavior or ritual. Common themes include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Fear of contamination by germs or dirt.</li>
                                <li>Doubts about having locked the door or turned off the stove.</li>
                                <li>Intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way.</li>
                                <li>Unwanted, intrusive thoughts about aggression, or religious or sexual subjects.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3>Compulsions</h3>
                            <p>Compulsions are repetitive behaviors that you feel driven to perform. These behaviors or mental acts are meant to reduce anxiety related to your obsessions or prevent something dreaded from happening. However, engaging in the compulsions brings no pleasure and may offer only a temporary relief from anxiety. Common themes include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Excessive hand-washing until your skin is raw.</li>
                                <li>Checking doors repeatedly to make sure they're locked.</li>
                                <li>Ordering and arranging things in a precise way.</li>
                                <li>Silently repeating a prayer, word, or phrase.</li>
                                <li>Counting in certain patterns.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </section>
                        
                        <section id="causes">
                            <h2>Causes & Risk Factors</h2>
                            <p>The cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder isn't fully understood. Main theories include a combination of biological, genetic, and environmental factors.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Biology:</strong> OCD may be a result of changes in your body's own natural chemistry or brain functions. There appears to be a connection to certain brain circuits that may not be functioning typically.</li>
                                <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> OCD may have a genetic component, but specific genes have yet to be identified. Having a first-degree relative with OCD increases the risk.</li>
                                <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Obsessive fears and compulsive behaviors can be learned from watching family members or gradually learned over time.</li>
                                <li><strong>Stressful Life Events:</strong> Experiencing traumatic or stressful events may trigger the intrusive thoughts, rituals, and emotional distress characteristic of OCD.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </section>

                        <section id="diagnosis">
                            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
                            <p>A diagnosis of OCD requires an evaluation by a mental health professional. The process typically involves a psychological evaluation that includes discussing your thoughts, feelings, symptoms, and behavior patterns. The professional will use the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to determine if your obsessions and compulsions are severe enough to be classified as OCD. To be diagnosed, the obsessions and compulsions must be time-consuming (take up more than an hour a day), cause major distress, or impair your work, social, or other important functions.</p>
                        </section>

                        <section id="treatment">
                            <h2>Treatment</h2>
                            <p>OCD treatment may not result in a cure, but it can help bring symptoms under control so that they don't rule your daily life. The two main treatments for OCD are psychotherapy and medications.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Psychotherapy</h3>
                            <p>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for many people with OCD. A specific type of CBT called Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is considered the gold standard. ERP involves gradually exposing you to your feared object or obsession and teaching you ways to resist the urge to perform your compulsive rituals. This process helps you learn that your anxious feelings will fade over time without the need for compulsions.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Medications</h3>
                            <p>Certain psychiatric medications can help control the obsessions and compulsions of OCD. Most commonly, antidepressants are tried first. Specifically, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often prescribed to help reduce OCD symptoms by increasing levels of serotonin in the brain. It can take several weeks to months to see benefits from medication.</p>
