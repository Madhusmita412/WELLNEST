                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>Depression, also known as major depressive disorder, is a common but serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think, and how you act. It is more than just feeling sad or going through a rough patch; it's a persistent mood disorder that requires understanding and medical care. Fortunately, depression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. By recognizing the signs and seeking help, individuals can manage their symptoms and return to a fulfilling, productive life.</p>

                            <h2>Types of Depression</h2>
                            <p>Depression comes in different forms. While they share common symptoms, specific types have unique characteristics that inform diagnosis and treatment.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</h3>
                            <p>This is the classic and most common form of depression. A person with MDD experiences persistent symptoms of sadness, loss of interest, and hopelessness for at least two weeks, which significantly interferes with their daily life.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)</h3>
                            <p>Dysthymia is a chronic form of depression where a low, dark mood occurs for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least two years. The symptoms are less severe than MDD but are long-lasting and can prevent you from feeling good or functioning well.</p>

                            <h3>Bipolar Disorder</h3>
                            <p>While a distinct condition, bipolar disorder involves episodes of depression. Individuals experience extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). During a depressive episode, the symptoms are similar to those of MDD.</p>

                            <h3>Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)</h3>
                            <p>SAD is a type of depression related to changes in seasons, beginning and ending at about the same times every year. For most people, it starts in the fall and continues into the winter months, sapping energy and causing moodiness. Treatment may include light therapy, psychotherapy, and medications.</p>

                        <section id="symptoms">
                            <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
                            <p>Symptoms of depression can vary from mild to severe and can affect a person emotionally, physically, and behaviorally. Common signs include:</p>
                            <ul>

                            <h2>Causes & Risk Factors</h2>
                            <p>The exact cause of depression is not known, but it is believed to be a complex combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Some common risk factors include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Brain Chemistry:</strong> Imbalances in neurotransmitters, the chemicals that carry signals in the brain, are thought to play a significant role.</li>
                                <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Having a close family member with depression increases the risk. Research is ongoing to identify specific genes involved.</li>
                                <li><strong>Major Life Events:</strong> Trauma, stress, the loss of a loved one, a difficult relationship, or any stressful situation may trigger depression.</li>
                                <li><strong>Medical Conditions:</strong> Chronic illness, chronic pain, or hormonal changes can contribute to the development of depression.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <section id="diagnosis">
                            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
                            <p>To be diagnosed with depression, you must be evaluated by a healthcare professional, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist. They will conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and possibly a physical examination to rule out other medical causes for your symptoms. The professional will ask about your symptoms, personal and family history of mental illness, and your daily functioning to determine if you meet the criteria for a depressive disorder as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).</p>

                        <section id="treatment">
                            <h2>Treatment & Management</h2>
                            <p>Depression is highly treatable, and the right plan often involves a combination of approaches tailored to the individual.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Psychotherapy</h3>
                            <p>Also known as "talk therapy," this is a foundational treatment for depression. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective forms, helping individuals identify and change negative thinking patterns and behaviors. Interpersonal therapy (IPT) and problem-solving therapy are also common.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Medications</h3>
                            <p>Antidepressants are commonly prescribed to help modify brain chemistry. The most popular types are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It's important to work closely with a doctor, as it can take time to find the right medication and dosage.</p>

                            <h3>Lifestyle & Home Remedies</h3>
                            <p>Alongside professional treatment, certain lifestyle changes can help manage symptoms. These include regular exercise, a healthy diet, getting enough quality sleep, practicing stress-management techniques like mindfulness, and building a strong support system.</p>
